my personal list of software for windows that i like or something

### System

* [WinCDEmu](https://github.com/sysprogs/WinCDEmu) - ISO-images (and other image types) CD/DVD/whatever emulator (also is able to create such images). Like Daemon Tools, Alcohol, etc., but very lightweight and integrates nicely with OS.
* [OpenHashTab](https://github.com/namazso/OpenHashTab) - In case you're not satisfied with 7-Zip's CRC SHA (or you have to use MD5 hash because reasons) or you want to have a "Hash" tab in file properties window. (just don't use it with Far manager)
* [LinkShellExt](https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html) - Symlinks from context menu
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - The archiver
  * [Windows 10 theme](https://github.com/brentini/7-Zip-Themes-Windows10) - So that it's a bit less ugly
* [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) - Instant file search

### Media
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) - The media player (unless it's MPV)
* [MPV](https://mpv.io/installation/) - The media player (unless it's VLC)
