my personal list of software for windows that i like or something

### System

* [WinCDEmu](https://github.com/sysprogs/WinCDEmu) - ISO-images (and others!!!) CD/DVD/whatever emulator (also is able to create such images). Like Daemon Tools, Alcohol, etc., but very lightweight and integrates nicely into system.
* [OpenHashTab](https://github.com/namazso/OpenHashTab) - In case you're not satisfied with 7-Zip's CRC SHA (or you have to use MD5 hash because reasons) or you want to have a "Hash" tab in file properties window. (just don't use it with Far manager)
